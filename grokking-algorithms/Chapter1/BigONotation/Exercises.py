# notes:
# uses worst-case scenario
# run time of algorithm is expressed in Big O notation
# all about the number of operations/growth 
# common Big O run times (from fastest to slowest):
# O(log n), aka log time
# O(n), aka linear time
# O(n*log n)
# O(n^2)
# O(n!)

# Exercises
# Give the run time for each of these scenarios in terms of Big O

# Exercise 1.3
# You have a name, and you want to find the person's phone number in the phone book
# Answer: O(log n)

# Exercies 1.4
# You have a name, and you want to find the person's phone number in the phone book
# Hint: You'll have to search through the whole book!
# Answer: O(n)

# Exercise 1.5 
# You want to read the numbers of every person in the phone book
# Answer: O(n)

# Exercise 1.6
# You want to read the numbers of just the As
# Answer: O(n)
