- problems that have no fast exact algorithmic solution
- to solve them exactly, you calculate every possible solution and pick the smallest/shortest one
- You know how to calculate the shortest way to get from point A to point B. But if you want to find the shortest path that connects several points, thatâ€™s the traveling-salesperson problem, which is NP-complete 
## examples
- [[set-covering problem]]
- [[problems/knapsack problem]]
- [[problems/traveling-salesperson problem]]
